# Cline Rules - Event Discovery App

## Additional Rules Files
This project uses multiple rules files organized in the `.cline/` directory:
- **project-rules.md** - Main project guidelines and architecture decisions
- **frontend-rules.md** - React Native specific coding standards
- **backend-rules.md** - Python backend development guidelines
- **api-rules.md** - External API integration patterns
- **ui-rules.md** - Design system and purple theme specifications

Refer to the project-rules map in `.cline/project-rules.md` for the complete rules hierarchy.

## Project Overview
- Event discovery app (Tinder-like) for NYC young professionals
- Frontend: React Native (Expo)
- Backend: Python
- Database: Supabase
- Target: iOS (primary), Android (secondary)

## Code Style & Standards
- Use 2-space indentation consistently
- Follow React Native and Python conventions
- Use camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for Python
- Include comments for complex swiping logic and API integrations
- Keep components small and focused (especially for swipe mechanics)

## File Organization
- `/src/components/` - React Native components (SwipeCard, Calendar, etc.)
- `/src/screens/` - Main screens (Discover, MyEvents, Profile)
- `/src/utils/` - Helper functions for swipe logic and API calls
- `/src/api/` - Supabase and external API integrations
- `/backend/` - Python backend code
- Keep tests alongside source files

## App-Specific Requirements
- Maintain smooth 60fps swiping animations
- Handle all 4 swipe directions (right: want to go, left: not interested, up: save later, down: like but can't go)
- Implement proper state management for calendar privacy settings
- Ensure real-time sync between Supabase and local state
- Handle offline capability for saved events

## Development Practices
- Test swipe mechanics thoroughly on actual devices
- Validate all user inputs and event data
- Handle API failures gracefully (Resy, OpenTable, etc.)
- Use environment variables for API keys and database credentials
- Implement proper error boundaries for React Native

## Key Features to Focus On
- Event swiping interface with 4-directional swipes
- Toggle between "Happening Now" and "Planning Ahead" feeds
- Personal calendar with privacy controls
- Social features with friend visibility rules
- Purple-themed UI with clean, minimal design

## External Integrations
- Supabase for database operations
- Resy/OpenTable APIs for restaurant events
- Maps integration for venue locations
- Push notifications for event reminders
- Calendar sync (Google/Apple)

## Privacy & Security
- Implement calendar privacy settings (Private, Friends only, Public events only)
- Secure handling of location data (NYC focus)
- Protect user swipe history and preferences
- Follow mobile app security best practices

## Git & Documentation
- Write clear commit messages for feature development
- Document API integrations and swipe logic
- Update setup instructions for React Native and Python backend
- Explain complex event curation and filtering logic

## Restrictions
- Never commit API keys or database credentials
- Don't hardcode event data - use dynamic API calls
- Ask before adding new external dependencies
- Maintain focus on NYC market initially
- Keep social features simple for MVP

## Questions & Clarifications
- Ask about event curation workflow details
- Clarify friend discovery and connection methods
- Request feedback on swipe animation performance
- Explain trade-offs for different privacy implementations
